EUP Going public against institutional constraints?  Analyzing the online presence intensity of 2014 European Parliament election candidates

This github repository contains the replication materials for the paper "Going public against Institutional Constraints? 
Analyzing the online presence intensity of 2014 European Parliament election candidates," forthcoming in European Union Politics, 
authored by Javier Lorenzo Rodríguez and Amuitz Garmendia Madariaga.

Abstract. 
Political parties and candidates have not been immune to the changes that the Internet and social media have introduced in electoral campaigns. Yet, as the use of digital media by political elites is becoming a norm in the United States, in Europe, the decision to develop an online presence depends on the cross-national differences regarding candidates’ constraints and incentives. 
European Parliament elections present an exceptional comparative opportunity to measure this potential diversity. 
Using an original database on the online presence of more than 5000 candidates competing under the label of incumbent parties in 2014, we demonstrate that there are two relevant groups of nonadopters, and that candidates’ online campaign intensity varies significantly depending on incumbency and the ballot structure in their countries.

This README file provides an overview of the replication materials for the article. The Data section describes the datasets required for the analysis, as well as those generated after the estimation. Note that the data files are not in this repository; they are only available in Dataverse. The Do file section contains the STATA code. A Data Codebook is also available for further clarification, as well as a text Appendix with examples of different social media profiles in the sample.
